# REST API

- **REST** stands for Representational State Transfer
- REST API is define as an interface that two computer system use to exchange information securely over the internet.
- REST is an architectural style for building distributed systems particularly web applications.
- The idea behind REST is to provide a standard way for systems to communicate with each other over the internet using a simple and lightweight protocol

- **REST** is based on few core principles :-

   - Client-Server architecture
   - Stateless communication
   - Resource-Based Interaction
   - Uniform Interface
   - Cacheable

- **API** is a set of rules that developers can use to build software that communicates with another system or application

## Stateless REST API

- A stateless REST API is an API that does not store any client-specific data or session information between requests. Each contains all the necessary information for the server to understand and process the request, without relying on any previous interactions or data .

## STATEFUL REST API

- A sateful REST API is an API that maintains state or context information between requests. The server stores information about the client and uses it to process subsequent requests.
